Throughout this work term, I have been involved in several projects within the Machine Learning team and the Software Development team, providing me with a valuable opportunity to gain exposure to different segments of our company’s process. While I cannot go into specific details due to confidential agreements, I will give an overview of the projects I have been or am currently working on. ### Liver Segmentation Machine Learning Model The primary objective of this project is to enhance the segmentation model for liver organ ultrasound image data. This involves utilizing data visualization techniques to facilitate the labeling process for supervised training, as well as developing Python and Bash scripts to retrieve the required data stored on the Google Cloud Storage Bucket for training the machine learning model. ### Serverless Function for Data Pipeline In this project, we are developing a serverless function on the Google Cloud Platform to support the data pipeline, including data storage, extraction, and pre-processing tasks. ### Cloud API Development The focus of this project is to develop the Cloud API, leveraging our Nest.js backend server, to support our machine learning data pipeline. ### Digital Signal Processing Codebase Restructure I am actively involved in restructuring our signal processing codebase using an object-oriented design strategy. The goal is to improve code efficiency and streamline the future development process of the company\\'s core product. To ensure the sanitization of our data, we do several thorough QA on the pipeline and the data. ### Device Connection Speed Test Service As a data-driven biotechnology company, we collaborate with various clinical sites worldwide to collect medical data for machine learning purposes. A stable internet connection is crucial for the efficiency of our data collection process. To ensure this, I have developed a lightweight speed test service that measures the end-to-end connection speed between our remote clinical devices and our backend server. The application employs React.js for the frontend interface and Nest.js as the backend service provider. The connection speed is measured through the data transfer of an allocated buffer, allowing us to assess and optimize the performance of our data transfer infrastructure. ### Machine Learning Data Analysis and Case Review To fine-tune our machine learning classification model, we conduct a weekly company-wide town hall meeting to review misclassified data cases. In order to provide valuable insights into the data, I identify the essential data points required for analysis. I then craft codes to organize and effectively output this information by seamlessly integrating an interceptor into our machine learning service. ## *@Properly* *Summer 2022* ## Work Term Overview Being a full stack development intern at Properly, which is my second co-op work term, entails a variety of activities. The projects, teamwork, and workplace culture will all be briefly covered in the following paragraph. Throughout the course of the four months of the work term, I have been working on two projects within an Agile-Scrum based team named \"Team Start\". The team\\'s primary goal is to drive as many new or returning customers to the corporate\\'s website as we can. As a tech-based real estate company, we draw consumers from internet traffic and direct them into different funnels based on their demands using marketing strategies on the layout of our website. For instance, a typical house buyer could wish to research and estimate the deal price of their selected properties; therefore, our team\\'s goal is to make it simpler for them to find the tool they need on our website and register their information for future engagement. The redesign of our company\\'s web landing page is the first project I have been working on. Collaboration with the project manager, the designer, and a solid grasp of front-end web development are all necessary for this. To create the website, two other full-time employees and I have been working as a three-person team. Later, we ran an A/B test on the new and old web pages to compare the number of customers two web pages has brought in. The development of Single Sign-On for Apple\\'s user account on our website was the second project we worked on. Setting up connections between our website\\'s frontend and backend, Amazon\\'s AWS services, and Apple\\'s authentication services is part of the effort. We spend a considerable amount of time communicating with different development teams and even external assistance from Amazon AWS services while dealing with an unexpected challenge during the development process. Nevertheless, they were all priceless and unique experiences over the course of the four months. The experience of the start-up culture is another crucial component of the work term. Properly is a new business that had only recently started before the pandemic began. Six cultural principles are upheld by the business: \"put people first,\" \"compete as a team,\" \"act like an owner,\" \"have strong opinions, loosely held,\" \"raise the bar,\" and \"dream big\" (Ruparell, 2022). Nearly all of them have been directly experienced by me through everyday collaboration with coworkers, weekly all-hands meetings when we set aside time to shout-out our appreciation to one another, and the value placed on employee-proposed ideas. Additionally, I have observed how openly the senior leadership team made decisions and how much time and effort people were willing to put into effective communication. Being in a hybrid work mode, I also enjoyed the vivid office environment, and took part in the company\\'s summer social, where we had a great time sailing on Lake Ontario. In addition to the weekly one-on-one meetings with my manager, I have had some constructive conversations with other senior developers as well. They give me incredibly valuable advice regarding my careers and plans. Overall, my experience at Properly has far surpassed my expectations.During this work term at the company, I hold a special job position as a co-op working both as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist.
